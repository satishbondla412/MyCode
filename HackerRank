Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
Explanation

Values in the tuple  form an Isosceles triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  form an Equilateral triangle, because . Values in the tuple  form a Scalene triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides  and  is not larger than that of side
